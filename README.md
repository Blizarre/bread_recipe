# Bread Recipe Webapp (Js/React/Bootstrap)

Bread recipe generator (In French)

I did it for my family as a quick way to generate fool-proof recipes.

It was my first non-trivial app in react. I quite liked the framework this time. And hopefully, being written in js, I won't have all the headaches associated with maintaining a typescript transpiling pipeline like for some other projects.
