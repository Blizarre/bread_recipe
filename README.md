# Bread Recipe Webapp (Js/React/Bootstrap)

Bread recipe generator (In French)

I did it for my family as a quick way to generate fool-proof recipes.

This is a reboot of my previous handmade react version. I asked Claude to make this one and while asking it to write the
code took 5 minutes, the js/ts bulid ecosystem is still a mess. I discovered [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) in the process which are pretty nice.
